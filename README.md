# VR Rail Shooter
An on-rail shooter is a type of game where basic movement is done automatically. The player is free to look around in any direction and to shoot in said direction. You'll most likely come across one of these type of games at nearly any arcade center. This is one made to be played in Virtual Reality.

## Software Analysis
Both Unity and Unreal already have VR support. A game on this scale is feasible on both engines. While I have a healthy amount of experience in Unity, I have never worked with Unreal before.

- [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/what-is-unreal-engine-4)
- No prior projects/experience
- Takes a long time to compile code
- Tedious debugging
- More heavy on Mac
- Less beginner friendly documentation
- Bigger file sizes
- Games tend to look quite pretty
- Ability to export to alot of platforms (though we only need PC VR)
- Can handle bigger projects than Unity
- Very versatile
- Big community
- Used by many AAA studios
- [Unity Engine](https://unity3d.com/)
- 2+ years of experience with multiple projects, though none in VR
- Prior Experience in shooting mechanics in C#
- Very quick compiling
- Easier debugging
- Much more beginner friendly documentation
- Runs on an older version of C#
- Overal weaker than Unreal
- Used more by indie developers rather than AAA

Given the rather small size of this project and the lack of need for paid custom tools, I decided to go with Unity. It's the engine I've got the most experience with and I feel most comfortable using.

## Goals of this project
- Have a functioning game in VR
- Get more experience with VR and Unity's integration of it
- Have something nice to show on my portfolio
- Get more experience with shooting mechanics
- Have the systems of this project be reusable for other projects
- Show that I can quickly make a concept playable
